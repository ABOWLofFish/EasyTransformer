do n't ask me why
i have to know the truth
tom won
do you want to know if your marriage will be successful
i told her not to go
why did this happen to me
this is obscene
you 've certainly been busy
i want tom and mary to say that they were wrong
you 'll pay for that
you 've gained weight
i made a thermos full of coffee so you can take it along with your lunch
tom wants to move to boston
ignore it
i 'm not able to speak so fast
i did n't look under the couch
i do n't have my license with me `` no problem i 'll drive ''
you are n't stupid
the cat is eating
i 'm never going to stop loving you
it 's time we moved on
the old man sometimes talks to himself
she understands music
are you the boss
a few students were left behind
tom was a bad person
i need a hammer to nail the boards
excuse me where 's the american embassy
i have bad breath
we both have the same problem
i have to buy shoes
i tried to be like you
brush your teeth
is it true that tom went to boston
the way she spoke to us was suspicious
we 're waiting to hear from tom
i realized i was off my guard
he seems to know the secret
which language is spoken in the united states of america
i do n't want to bother tom
it 'll surely rain today
you were absent from school yesterday
you are really full of curiosity are n't you
last night i threw up
she 's going to ooita
i use all kinds of software to study chinese
if only i could speak english
i was not studying then
he studies american history
he likes to sing in the bathtub
i 'm not done yet
your father loves you
no one wants to go there
they meant well
tom is the only boy who does n't like football
tom asked me if i was angry
i got a letter from a friend of mine in japan
he got lost while walking in the woods
i have so many things i do n't need
i do n't know what caused it
tom closed his mouth
everest is the highest mountain in the world
i saw that he came
he 's two years older than mary is
she called the students into the room
you like english do n't you
no one could solve the problem
they already got married
tom is a man of wisdom and experience
can i exchange this with something else
i prefer the flavor of fresh-water fish
tell me what happened
did you hear about tom 's resignation
it 's better to take your time at this job than to hurry and make mistakes
let 's fly kites
shut your big mouth
i have trouble talking about my feelings
take good care of yourself
why did you tell tom that you do n't know me
i want an attorney
i paid 800 yen for this book
you must start at once
who is it `` it 's me ''
i think about that from time to time
i did n't expect help
i do n't watch that program anymore
i spoke to the actress herself
what color do you think she likes
i live near the dike
my hair is long
tom left a message on mary 's answering machine
how do you intend to fix this
you 're taller than me
you ought not to have spent so much money on your hobby
mary is left-handed
we will have breakfast at eight o'clock
i think this is very rare
i 'll never forget the sound the crash made
i have a shower every night
tom told mary to park somewhere else
tom admitted that what mary said was true
do n't be a fool
albert einstein 's theory of relativity is the most famous formula in the world
tom ate breakfast all by himself
what if he comes back now
i know you 're right
he survived an accident last year but still drives recklessly
it does n't make sense to criticize someone for doing something that we would do if we were in their situation
blow out all the candles on the birthday cake at once
please forgive me
get out of the classroom
you can use whichever pen i 'm not using
they 're listening
love conquers all
that word is very hard to translate
i was the last one out

should i close
i wanted to speak with you first
they headed downstairs
i have orders
tom volunteered a good deal of his time to helping those less fortunate than himself
i want to go out with her
it makes me sad to think of his death
what did you say your name was
i do n't like the way he looks at you
my fate is in your hands
i invited her to a movie
i ca n't find my briefcase
you 'd be amazed how much time tom spends playing games
she held him tightly

it was ages ago
he has a swimming pool
tom depends on mary too much
i 'm not angry
you 're driving too fast
they ca n't fire you
i wanted to ask you some questions about tom
tom has dark skin
i found it by chance
my sister usually goes to the park every weekend
they 'll be fine
the school is only a five-minute walk away
careless driving causes accidents
she clutched her baby in her arms
she came back in about thirty minutes
i 've made up my mind to study harder from now on
the most important thing is the ability to think for yourself
i remember
older people often fear change
tom screamed like a woman
the buildings were damaged by the storm last night
that sounds amazing
he had two hundred head of cattle
she got caught
may i go home now
the short term contract employees were dismissed without notice

i was n't there
that 's what tom told me
hand in your papers
i owe you a big apology
i caught tom flirting with my wife

i 'll cook
the children love listening to stories
tom was n't able to contact mary by phone

i still love you
maryam is well behaved
they 'll be safe here

the air conditioner is out of order
how long do i have to wait
when i called on him he was talking on the phone
you may give the book to whoever wants it
sorry what 's your name
where 's the bread

the game was called off
i need you here in case something else happens
you ca n't leave tom behind
i was n't ready to go

i ca n't believe that you actually got into harvard
this is a good house
he decided to submit his resignation
we worry about your future

i 'm trying to be happy
your english is perfect
i can not meet their demands
do you think i 'd be stupid enough to come here without a weapon
this problem baffles me
i like fruits such as oranges and apples
she denied having met him even though we saw them talking to each other
forty-eight sailors are on board
tom is n't here now
tom dyed his hair blue

the man claimed he did n't take the money
i saw her at the station
we 're investigating the murder of tom jackson
how 's your brother
i loved her
put the vegetables in the strainer
fish are cold-blooded animals
how much should i pay
she would rather go by train than by plane
i told you it was stupid
the train will arrive soon
i hope we achieve that
i was overtaken by greed
you did n't listen
no gift is more precious than trust

it makes little difference
my little sister does n't like the taste of cottage cheese
what do you say to going out for a short walk
it just feels different
i do n't like to cook when it 's hot outside
it 's harsh but fair
my ear was bleeding this morning
please put a lump of sugar in my coffee
nobody did anything
is tomorrow a holiday
you can visit me tomorrow
he walks slowly
i used to work with tom
just because he likes painting does n't mean he 's good at it
does this fit
we have to gather information
you 'll be safe here
your camera is only half the size of mine
it 's great to see you
please fill out this questionnaire and send it to us
i know what you are thinking
a selfish man thinks of nothing but his own feelings
this mine will close down next month
may i have a glass of milk please
tom was like a father to mary
they seemed to be discussing a matter of great importance
