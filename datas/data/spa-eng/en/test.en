she was wearing a splendid outfit
you have some books
tom advised mary not to borrow too much money from john
go to sleep tom
what language do they speak in the united states
tom did it in his own way
tom does n't know how it happened

i really appreciate that
his brother passed away last month
good luck tom
tom ran out of money
he traveled west by train
where did you get that
i know it was n't tom

i have n't heard from her since then
why do you spend so much time watching tv
i 've been told that i 'm a good kisser
i looked for a place to crash
the towel is dry
tom taught me how to drive
they have taken her away
the old lady lived in a three-room apartment by herself
my opinion is irrelevant
tom sees things
how much money do you have
nothing will distract us
we 're willing to help you
tom stabbed mary with a spear
when will you get home
a hideous monster used to live there
they do n't speak french
it 's not a game
not a cloud was to be seen
i have no idea
at first i did n't like him
you should have attended the meeting
he sat smoking on the bench
he 's not as strong as before
tom used to go to school with mary
i have to eat
what he lacked in wit he made up for in energy
tom hung his coat on one of the hooks near the door
would tom accept your help if you offered it
this medicine does not have side effects
he gets a haircut once a month
i do n't think that changes anything
you are the one
he 's very angry with you
i 've been waiting here nearly three hours
you are dreaming
i do n't like that name
he advocates a revision of the rules
how 's your cold
i do n't know why he 's crying
it 's supposed to snow tomorrow
i 've been married twice
the lake is very deep
tom knows how to fight
how do you account for that

he stretched out his arm to take the book
when does your summer vacation start
why were you fired
here is a basket full of vegetables
i left africa forever
i know i 've let you down
tom decided to start a business
none of your business
some people believe in ghosts
are you kidding
i 'm at a loss for words
there are more stars in the sky than i can count
i can do a lot of things
they just taught me to swear
do you want me to bring you anything
if it rains he wo n't come
tom fell down and hurt himself
i read a lot of books in english

the criminal left footprints
i got a new camera
i want you to sing a song
tom retired from the company in 2013
she listened to music for hours
we must go to school
i saw a soldier carrying a flamethrower
it 's my book
that 's just a personal opinion
he is a gentleman among gentlemen
i need to find my pen
tom did n't know mary had a brother
i thought tom would go to the bank and get some cash

this is the diary which she kept
what i want is n't tea but coffee
i 'm going to join the school orchestra
i have a book about fishing

he had a lot of money in the bank
they 're typical youngsters
do you have any alternatives to the plan
the tv 's on
i like the simplicity of her dress
they all rose
i 'm trying to work out this problem
nobody knows the truth
you 're always disagreeing with your boss
look in the mirror
he glared at me fiercely
that 's all i know
nobody was expecting that
he disappeared in the crowd
i 'm fairly hungry
i missed the train by a minute
you ca n't sit with me
all the desk drawers were empty
i have enough money to buy a car
it must 've been a shock to you
tom kicked the stool out from under mary
the boy released a bird from the cage
i was n't talking about you
take heed of her advice
we have to go somewhere else
she 'll come at quarter past three
i remember a time when we could tell each other anything
both his brothers are teachers
why should he leave
do you bowl
it is n't safe to walk alone at night
that 's really sad
tell me your story i am all ears
that 's really stupid
keep your hands clean
the king always wears a crown
do n't oppose him
he caught sight of a ship in the distance

i want you to stay where you are
i need some soap
just do your best
who did you go with
his ambition is to be a lawyer
we 're not accusing you of anything
everything is going well
tom pretended to be mary 's friend
this is my brainchild
he is not fond of sports and i am not either
could you just take me home please
tom disagrees with mary on that matter
that 's troubling
tom will never forgive you
i do n't really know why
this is as large as that
a big wave turned over his canoe
i do n't like such sports as boxing and hockey
i know it is n't always easy

i live here
tom could n't find what he wanted at the supermarket

the snowstorm continued
i 'm sure tom would rather be somewhere else
tom did n't have enough space to do what he wanted to do
we 'll give you anything you want
they 're average students
i 'll be right outside
they 're arguing

there always seems like there is something to do
i hope you are not thinking it is my fault

he used pigeons in his experiment
i have n't seen anything
i do n't want your help
tom could n't understand what mary was saying
that 's an ugly building in my opinion
she went with him
he worked at night and slept in the daytime
i want to speak with tom now
she speaks portuguese
where are you going in such a hurry girl
tom will never tell you what really happened
i do n't think it 's true
we 're being watched
you ca n't know that for sure
tom opened the door for mary
he 's quite formal when he meets a stranger
she is a difficult person to deal with
i thought i 'd try eating mexican food today
you know we love you
that 's a huge organ
the post office is located in the center of the town
are you afraid of tom
i had trouble getting a taxi
i was foolish enough to believe him
the room is dark
stay out of my way
stay focused
i hope you know what this is
people said that he is insane
tom handed mary the letter opener
that man was a wretch
it is a privilege to meet you
this spoon is for tea

is that what he wants
this place gives me the creeps
we were both pretty busy at that time
we are going to the market
tom never thinks about others
i work as a consultant
i 'm speaking with my student
this is a pencil
i thought tom was coming home with you
do you think anyone will be able to overhear what we 're talking about
she heard him scream so she ran into his bedroom
the weather turned better
i 'm already busy
how do we know we can trust tom
i 'd like to sail around the world
there 's no cure
tom is a personal friend
my sister often cries
this theory is too difficult for me to comprehend
that 's absolute nonsense
i asked for a seat in the no-smoking section

tom wanted to stick around to see what would happen unfortunately he had to leave
i 'm feeling confused

the two men accused each other
how many siblings do you have
she has achieved her goals
we all laughed at his pink tuxedo
tom and mary said they wanted to be left alone
she 'd rather be spending time with someone else
do you know where tom is from
one potential problem is that tom ca n't speak french very well
the soup needs more salt
i ca n't find him anywhere

europeans like to drink wine
where did you get all that money from

i am confused
anything that can be misunderstood will be
people are more conscious nowadays and choose healthy food
he 's a lawyer
he was laughed at in public

the situation has come to the point where we either sink or swim
is your school far from your home
i think it will be fine
i think tom was hiding something
money is not everything
yesterday was monday
he asked me to speak more slowly
tom will likely be discharged from the hospital tomorrow

i just got the baby to sleep
suddenly the dog started barking
i do n't have any money
we heard the door closing

where does this book go
do you want to get married
this just has to be his umbrella
tom took a piece of candy from the bag
get ready for some action
i remember what you told me
you 're my friend
i wish i had brought an umbrella
he was worn out after hours of work
it took us a long time but finally we were able to find it
how do you feel
i hope it goes well
when did it happen
snakes are cold-blooded creatures
who wants this
i am pressed for time

i ca n't trust what she says
may i leave my luggage here where it is and go out
they are still looking for the criminal
she can say whatever she wants

i clean my room almost every day
i 've lost my umbrella
it 's out of my hands now
who sent you
the teacher made him stay after school
i do n't like christmas anymore
tom broke his neck falling down a flight of stairs
i do n't get it
i did n't want to make a big deal out of it
we showed him some pictures of the alps
tom is obsessive
i would rather you had n't told him the truth

i noticed some mistakes in his report

i 'm an adult
his death was great shock to his wife
whenever i get on the subway i put my wallet in my front pocket
her ideas are quite original
i wanted to surprise her
tom always treats mary like a child
she trembled with fear
let 's keep our fingers crossed
let 's forget it
my wisdom teeth are coming in
tom hired mary as an interpreter
we must be ready for anything
nobody can save me
judging from his expression he is in a bad mood
it 's easier to teach children than adults
i heard that one way to stay healthy is to avoid eating any food with unpronounceable ingredients
tom knows that mary does n't like raw eggs
he read a passage from shakespeare
our electric heater did not work well
stop saying that

i would n't be so sure about that
nobody heard tom 's screams
the thief fled without leaving any traces
i 'd like to have this film processed
they built a fence around the farm
for some reason or other i can not bring myself to work
televisions with vacuum tubes are regarded as being behind the times
i want to meet with tom
i 'm not here to arrest you
if you had told me earlier i would have dressed up
tom persuaded his mother to lend him the car for the weekend
each person has his own way of doing things
he changed his mind
i waited for her to speak
she was asked not to speak at the meeting

it was so cold that no one wanted to go outside
did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters
you could at least try
i 'm to blame not you
how long does it take

he has his own car
this is all your fault
i heard about your problems with tom
there was a cat on the table

she greeted me with a smile
where is today 's paper
i did all the work
why does everybody love cats
