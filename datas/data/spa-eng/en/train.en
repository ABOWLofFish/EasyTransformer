tom got into bed
tom hid in the attic
tom died three days after he arrived in boston

tom is the one who convinced mary to help
i used to be a teacher
did you understand the moral of this story
tom has a ticket
tom is a dim-witted but good-hearted fellow
why are you telling this to me now
tom ca n't see anything with his left eye
tom is an honest boy so he would n't tell a lie
he will be coming to the party
save it on the external hard drive
they 're alive
the view from the summit is very nice
it never occurred to me that tom might not be telling the truth
tom has been trapped
it wo n't hurt i promise
when we started out we only had six employees
i was on the point of leaving home when a light rain started to fall
add a little milk
do you want to know what i think is going on

tom started dreaming
tom could n't understand why mary laughed at him
my french is n't very good
tom does n't know what went wrong
all tom wanted was for mary to play a couple of tunes on her ukulele
you have no need to hurry
he has a long nose
tom likes sitting on the beach in the early morning
violence is the cancer of our society
they stopped talking
i do n't think i 'd mind eating chinese food every day
to tell the truth i 'm not in favor of it at all

it may sound strange but it is true
an idea came to me
you 're my enemy
i need to see tom right now
tom is still just as friendly as he used to be
i just want to go to bed
it 's hard to believe that tom was n't aware that mary was in love with him
the weather forecast says that it 's going to snow this evening

what did tom say
cats were sacred animals in ancient egypt

i have not seen him in months
how about 12:45
i knew you 'd find tom
he is something of an artist
three children were playing in the park
we 're not so young that we do n't understand what love is
can you frame this picture
there 's no one in the room
do you play golf
i do n't know anything about the future
is it close enough to walk there
have you gone nuts
the police arrested the suspect in the case
tom put some rice in a bowl
there 's a sandwich here
i lost my key
what should i do in a situation like this
here 's one for you
their dreams came true
the boy is able to memorize everything he reads

may i leave now
tom has to get up early
it was saturday night
he 'll never forgive me

i 'll buy him a pencil
which is the most difficult language in the world
where did you see that woman
it looks like he will win
tom put our names on the list
tom will find out
tomorrow i am going shopping
may i kiss you
i waited for three hours
he gripped my hand
i am packing up my things
something very unusual seems to be happening in the park
i almost bought one of those
tom wondered who mary had driven to the airport
i doubt anyone said that
he took out one egg
i could kill you
a man came over and asked if i was ok
i ate on the bus
what should i do next
i want to help you but i ca n't
that red car hit the blue van
i asked tom to come yesterday but he did n't come
i slid the window shut
what was that
i 'm writing a letter
she leaned on his shoulder
tom walked as fast as he could to catch up with mary
do you think animals have a soul
what is the nationality of that cameraman over there
i wonder where i put my glasses
my grandfather loves to read
he left the motor running
you must go outside if you want to smoke
tom told mary and mary told john
from now on i 'll try to help you with the work
i went to boston last year
if you want your workers to be happy you need to pay them a decent wage
some of the students were late for school
the church was built hundreds of years ago
tom did n't even get to say goodbye
it 's making me nervous
have you told everyone when the meeting will be
wash your face before you go to school
this is my favorite outfit
how long does it take to get from here to your house on foot
tom has recently become forgetful
you do n't have to believe me
tom was hired
do you want a ride
she met him only recently
is there something that you want
the noise gets on my nerves
not all men are wise
where do we know each other from
she lowered her voice
he lives by himself in the woods
can you add these numbers
since i had a slight fever i stayed in bed
something embarrassing happened last week
i know the gentleman
i got soaked to the skin
there 's nothing more i can do
it just was not my day yesterday
the question still remains why tom would want to do that
there 's too much at stake
it 's only a temporary solution
the only reason tom went to the party was that he expected mary to be there
tom is talking with mary
after conferring for several hours they made the agreements public
do seedless watermelons exist
mary opposed her son 's decision to get married
you will miss japanese food in the united states
i do n't feel like talking to anybody

there was a cherry tree growing in the garden
we 're doing nothing
i wanted to talk with you

my mother 's going to kill me
tom intervened in his coworkers ' disagreement
cops are everywhere
i usually sleep eight hours a day
he arrived at the station out of breath
tom wondered how much tequila mary could drink before she passed out
the two streets run parallel to one another
i like spicy mexican food
he arrived after the bell rang
she was fond of talking about herself
i think death is preferable to shame

what are you reading now
there will be a big earthquake in the future
i 'm familiar with the situation
tom had no idea what mary wanted him to do
that was inappropriate
i feed my dog two cups of dog food every evening
tom knows we are n't busy
a crowd collected to watch the fight
tom has been reading a book all afternoon
let me ask you something tom do you think we really have a chance
it may save your life
he 's our only suspect
move along please
when was the last time you received treatment
i have many friends in foreign countries
god loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life
we saw some houses in the distance
he came into the room
tom said he had a plan
we have no choice but to carry on
the television does n't work
i 'd love to be your age
that does n't change a thing
tom almost never complains about anything
there 's still a lot to learn
tom is n't here yet
let me feel it
he stays up till late at night
correcting is sometimes harder than writing
you said i was a liar
he slept in the car
tom felt like a fish out of water
women do n't usually want to talk with me
it 's a step in the right direction
i do n't know whether you are telling the truth or not
i do n't like him any more than he likes me
all i can say is that i 'd rather not go
it was stiflingly hot
the police blamed the accident on the taxi driver
as our fingers touched i felt a shiver run through me
tom almost always walks to work
we are just friends
tom keeps an extra pair of shoes in the trunk of his car
this must be done
do n't they take care of the dog
these shoes are old but i still like them
he stopped reading the newspaper
why are you always so cynical
tom felt tired
he talks fast
it 's too easy
i used to like boston
they wanted something better
wring those clothes well before you hang them up
they may come
tom does n't think that he has anything to do with the matter
he broke his left arm
you 'll never be alone
would you like ice
i 'm going to study french
a beautiful woman like you should n't be eating alone
perhaps she will come tomorrow

he jumped onto the table
tom has lost his voice
i had sore legs the next day
it 's been five years since i last saw you
he has a terrible hangover
there 's a pay phone over there
the trip out was more pleasant than the return
this tastes like tea
he knows how to whistle
i do n't know what 's going on
i want to be paid in cash
we are sorry we ca n't help you
do n't go out after it gets dark
he was overcome by a feeling of melancholy
i 'm planning on losing some weight
i am glad that you have succeeded
do n't bury your head in the sand
that 's pretty bad
i hope they do n't resort to violence to accomplish their goals
i saw tom hitting mary
our water pipes burst
i like to sing
what do we need to do today
do you want to play
do come in
it was too difficult for me
i dreamt about you
take off your shoes
you 're still wrong
did n't you take precautions
i promise you i 'll help you
i hurt my foot
tom should do the same
put your room in order
a blind person 's hearing is often very acute
i 'm sorry the flight is full
perhaps she will come tomorrow
the more i think of it the less i like it
even smart people are sometimes absent-minded
tom ca n't wait to get started
tom is my ex
you ca n't cling to the past
they were too tired to climb a mountain
would you rather go fishing or go hunting

whose pen is this
do n't talk so loud
we went bear hunting together the other day
some people do n't wear pajamas
i 'll ask him
which do you like better meat or fish
how long have you been swimming
he 's not a very meticulous guy
you 're babbling
i got here at 2:30
it 's all i have
tom has never heard mary speak french
i saw him sawing a tree
he finally achieved what he set out to do
only a handful of people came to the meeting
that dog is big
i do n't know how to thank you
we 're not the only canadians here
he should be angry
tom does n't like women
i thought you wanted tom to marry you
it 's time to go to sleep
do you speak french
i know the boy standing over there
i wo n't say a word

how is your last name written
he caught hold of a rope and saved himself
i 've enjoyed this novel very much
it 's our duty to help
milk is made into butter and cheese
we should eat
you have to obey your parents
everybody is laughing
you 're efficient are n't you
i think that tom lives somewhere around here
which season do you like the best
take a walk every day
tom wants to show you something
do n't worry we 're not going to leave you
you have to do it
they 're looking for it
you know i 'm not coming back right
tom does n't believe in evolution
are you losing your mind
you deal with it
i would do it if i could

i 'm really surprised you got the prize

how many books did you read
i 'd like to go out with you
how far did you go
i have a sharp pain in my chest
when we go to a restaurant i never order the same thing tom does
i am proud of never being late for school
we sat there
you look great in these photos
it 's up to you
this is not enough
ants have a well-organized society
what am i doing here
my english teacher has advised me to read these books
there are still a lot of things i do n't know about tom
the price of this camera is exorbitant
she went out to buy some food
a child who is a native speaker usually knows many things about his or her language that a non-native speaker who has been studying for years still does not know and perhaps will never know
my book is on your desk
i ate leftovers for lunch
all of us approved of the plan
i try to keep a low profile now
a language is not something you learn all at once
tom does n't know who he can trust anymore
how long will you have to wait

i 'd like to talk to one of your guests
i had hoped that my mother would live until i got married
tom is useless
tom knew that mary was throwing a party
tell me what you 're thinking
they live on the floor beneath
no one can blame you for being a little scared
i never expected tom to get out of prison
she passed away yesterday afternoon
get your mind out of the gutter
she has a brother in tokyo
she almost fainted
i had already heard that song once
neither of these is mine
it is strange that he has not come yet
tom will never live up to his parents ' expectations
he came to my house
she married him when she was 20
where can i find tom
a long time ago when pluto was still a planet there was a boy named tom
do n't shoot
i wish i had more time to talk with you
she showed me her album
i had my hat blown off by the wind
tom needs a friend
i think tom will be able to solve the problem
we lack nothing
the ship passed through the panama canal
tom is deceitful
tom took little sips of the piping hot coffee
tom runs a company in boston

tom is different from other boys

tom looks genuinely interested
tom does n't like to stay at home
my father does n't approve of her
one of the names on the list was mine
her skirt is yellow with polka dots
there 's something moving in the next room

employers sometimes exploit their workers
it is rumored there are treasures hidden there
how about stopping the car and taking a rest

he will be my deputy while i am away
i ca n't believe that you would n't enjoy playing cards with me and my friends
i do n't want to play checkers
our financial problems are serious
i require advice
tom could n't live up to mary 's expectations
this may be of use to you
i left my briefcase on the bus
tom knows the secret
my sister asked me to teach her how to ski
do you plan to work until 10:00
you must do your best

something you should know about me is that i 'm addicted to computer games
he is the son of a wealthy family
tom has three french dictionaries
i know this is difficult
sometimes we argue about things that do n't matter that much
all the critics praised the new movie
i came home empty handed

his family are all very well
i found out where she is
that man 's not to be trusted

someone saved my life
speak for yourself
do you think parents should punish their children when they lie

i ca n't tell you how much this means to me
i saw tears in her eyes

i should 've told you
one potential problem is that tom ca n't speak french very well

i was worn out
tom gave mary a threatening look
he made a mistake
i think it 's time for me to shove off
they keep making that allegation
he seems unable to swim
where are the cops
he hesitated for a while
when is the last time you wrote a love letter
please choose one person
i 'm far from happy about this situation
i 'll be back right away
the house is on the most level part of the ground
we agreed to start early
it was tom who first suggested that this might be the cause
you ought to thank him
i only have eyes for you
did he stay very long
i do n't think that 's enough
do you know what it is
they trust tom
i have better things to do with my time
i 'll do whatever it takes
i have lost my keys
tom cheered
i can still help you
in general young people today are not interested in politics
this should do it
you 've lost a lot of blood
he 's not sure he wants to do this

tom no longer works here
the ticket is valid for a week
they 're special
when do you expect him back
how 's school
this is uncle tom 's farm
he lives in a luxury apartment close to central park
tom walked down the path whistling a happy tune
that 's right is n't it

i like red wine better than white
everyone knows the law
if you ca n't have children you could always adopt

it 's cold out there
please come and see me if you have time
have you ever seen him swimming
are you still in boston
tom 's great-great-grandfather was a pirate
her car might be more pleasant to drive but it also costs her more for maintenance
now hold on
i ordered tom to do it
i have an appointment to visit a guru in india
they condemned him for his cruelty to animals
i 'm looking forward to seeing tom
how long does it take to get there from here
the plane took off at exactly ten o'clock

poverty drove him to steal
tom does n't think it 's such a big deal

tom called mary at about 2:30
i 'm hit
it is really nice of you
war does n't make anybody happy
why do that now
i 'm only doing this because i have nothing better to do
my shoes are the same size as his
i will be very careful

the objection is sustained
i have a lot of work to do
i 'm so tired that i 'm going to bed as soon as i get home

she may be cute but i do n't like her
some of my friends can speak english well

you ca n't stop me
i 'll miss you when you 're gone
his life hangs on the judge 's decision
i do not play the piano
i have n't given them to tom yet
i 'm grateful
tom assured mary that he 'd help her paint the ceiling of her kitchen
tom does n't remember anything
tom is calling back
he produced a rabbit out of his hat by magic
that 's what i need to find out
he led a life of luxury
what do you think of his new novel
he ran through the streets naked
i think your skirt 's too short
i have a feeling you 'll be a very good lawyer
tom knows
we do n't miss anything
is there enough money to get a bottle of wine
everybody has a right to his own opinion however sometimes it 's better not to tell anybody what that opinion is

he never fully recovered from his injuries
who 's that

tom should n't be so surprised
i just cut my finger
it 's tom 's only chance
will you teach me french
dad gave me a computer game
tom shot mary 's dog

i 'm sorry i 'm so late
i should n't have done that
we did n't see him anywhere
i had no one to turn to
are you fluent in french
the theory is too abstract for me
tom cut his finger on a piece of glass
that 's something you 'll regret
this was n't an easy decision for us
tom ate the leftover pizza for breakfast
are they hiding something
they are as strong as us
i do n't have a favorite shirt
i 'm going there now
tom 's lunch includes a sandwich and an apple
what happened to your eye
i 'm not rich enough to buy that
do you think i 'm kidding
my roommate is learning chinese
it 's against the rules to smoke at the office
tom is my guest
instead of complaining maybe you should help
how much does that cost per day
i disagree with that
do n't do it
tom is n't as intelligent as you
you are too ready to speak ill of others
i heard it thunder in the distance
my parents do n't know
we heard the boy playing the violin
that 's not what i 'm here for
that 's not my fault
the house is on fire
tom just shrugged
they 're going to the war
who did you talk to
you should keep your windshield clean
i only did that because i had nothing better to do
it 's a matter that concerns all of us
we went to the park to play
the train was delayed for an hour
he is very talented
potatoes are very cheap
could i have a piece of cheesecake
love is like oxygen
which car is ours
the new designs are much better than the old ones
tom is a reckless driver
come on let 's try it
my brother is an idiot
the moment he saw me he grew pale and ran away
i 'm very shy
why are you so interested in what tom thinks
was that you in the car
tom understood it completely
no one uses that kind of weapon anymore
do you want me to explain it again
the king and his family live in the royal palace
that young lady is a nurse
if he had worked harder he might be a rich man now
it 's already november but it has n't snowed yet
what 's your area of specialization
tom carried everything he owned in a small suitcase
tell me something that i do n't know
she 's pregnant with twins
you should n't be here
tom ca n't remember where he put his sunglasses
she hit him
they made many charges
do n't tell your mother what you 've seen here
i did n't go into details
i am helping my grandfather
who is in this room
tom seems surprisingly calm
tom and mary are talking to john
he was speaking
that 's the biggest elephant i 've ever seen
i 'd like to have a coffee
he 's collecting various data
how big you are
it took me three days to read this book
if i die i want you to keep this ring
i have work on wednesday
it tasted sweet
i like your profile picture
tom was shocked by what mary said
now she 's gone mad
i know the boy
can i use the phone
i ate fish yesterday
this room is very cold
there are some things money ca n't buy
when was the last time you played soccer
he is proud of his family
i knew you 'd come back
she came back an hour later
i know them all
tom is n't in the hospital
this is the place where the battle took place
that 's hers
the tourists wandered around the stores
she traveled all over the world
she knitted her father a sweater
i 'm sure tom is just trying to help
you can probably guess what happens though
we waited for you all day long
what does it feel like
i wo n't stand for it anymore
i gave him my phone number
it smells like tom
i think maybe that 's all you have to do
he missed the train by a minute
i have nothing to do this afternoon
after you finish reading the book put it back where it was
you must be from australia
the down jacket that i bought yesterday cost me a lot less than i had expected
the fish wants to escape
give him the message when he comes back
you will soon be convinced i am right
you probably think you know how to do this but let me explain it once more
am i wrong
do n't you want to know why i did n't do that
when is my flight
they ate marshmallows
which do you like better the sea or the mountains
what grade is your sister in
it is important for them to do their best
what year were you born
she married him only because her parents made her
we have had little snow this winter
he likes playing football
you should choose your friends very carefully
she kept me waiting for 30 minutes
the city was alarmed by the earthquake
that boy is a chatterbox
what do you see in the picture

let 's take a closer look at the matter
thank you so much for inviting me
come here and i 'll show you
i love to see you smile

tom volunteered to help
there 's nothing more i can tell you
tom seconded the motion
tom fell in love with his best friend 's girlfriend
tom does n't have anything to eat
when i came to japan i burned my bridges
the family lived in poverty
i do n't eat the core of an apple
who cares what they think
my new phone is thinner than my old phone
tom was rejected
do you want to know what your problem is
are your kids still in bed
empty cans were scattered about the place
would you like to earn some extra money
i missed the last train last friday
you 're the prettiest girl in town
a light bulb gives light
all taxpayers have the right to know where their money goes
tom wants mary
he was court-martialed for dereliction of duty
she sweeps the room with a broom
he is five feet tall
i 'd like to speak with you alone
he asked his friend for advice
tom 's answers were wrong
it can only get worse
we do n't need you to do that anymore
i am busy

the enemy of my enemy is my friend
i would rather stay at home than go shopping
she blackmailed him
does tom enjoy watching horror movies
what 're you babbling about
you need a miracle
she will give birth in july
i do n't want to ever speak to you again
i freaked out
at the most you 'll only be 30 minutes late
i saw him looking at me
you need to be ready for whatever happens
i looked all over the house for that letter
it 's mine not his
those girls look like guys
i did n't know that was possible
it 's a pity that you ca n't come
the police found some blood on the floor
will you tell me what i should do next
you may come with us if you want to
why are n't you already on board the ship
he prided himself on his self control
what makes you think that i want to be left alone
do you know why they stopped talking
go and help wash the dishes
i have lived here for ten years
i 've actually never seen it
i do n't want you to tell tom

it 's important to read a lot of books
i thought you would n't notice that tom was n't here
their names escaped me
we wo n't forgive you
do you know why she could n't come
we stopped along the way to have lunch
i have not read all the books

she first met him in boston
tom did n't know how unhappy mary was

my book has to be somewhere in the room
i 'm drunk but i can still speak german
almost three thousand people died
i 'm here to protect you
it took them some time to get used to one another
tomorrow is a holiday
it seemed that no one was in the village

how do you say `` good bye '' in german
tom might be able to do that but i doubt it
this is never going to end
that 's disappointing
